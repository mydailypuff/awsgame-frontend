# Code Structure Analysis

## Overview
This is a Node.js web application frontend that appears to be a game-related project. The application uses:
- Express.js as the web framework
- EJS for templating
- OpenID Client for authentication
- Express Session for session management
- CORS for cross-origin resource sharing
- dotenv for environment variable management

## File Structure
- `app.js`: Main application entry point
- `package.json`: Project dependencies and metadata
- `/public`: Static assets directory
  - `/styles`: CSS stylesheets
    - `dice.css`: Styling for dice-related components
    - `gameEntry.css`: Styles for game entry views
    - `home.css`: Main home page styling
    - `nextScene.css`: Styling for scene transition components

## Notable Dependencies
- express (v4.21.2)
- ejs (v3.1.10)
- openid-client (v5.7.0)
- express-session (v1.18.1)
- cors (v2.8.5)
- dotenv (v16.4.7)

## Application Flow
The application implements a game-related web interface with the following key components:

1. **Server Setup**
   - Express.js server configuration with middleware for static files, CORS, and sessions
   - EJS templating engine configuration
   - Environment variables loaded via dotenv

2. **Authentication Flow**
   - OpenID Connect authentication integration using openid-client
   - Client initialization with configurable issuer, client ID, and secret via environment variables
   - Protected routes using checkAuth middleware
   - Session management for user state and tokens
   - Handles authentication state, nonce, and OIDC callback
   - Stores user info and access tokens in session
   - Token-based access control for game routes

3. **Routes**
   - `/`: Home route, displays main landing page with authentication status
   - `/dice`: Renders the dice rolling interface
   - `/login`: Initiates OpenID Connect authentication flow
   - `/callback`: Handles OpenID authentication callback
   - `/gameEntry`: Protected route for game entry/lobby
   - `/nextScene`: Protected route for scene transitions

4. **Static Assets**
   - CSS files organized by component:
     - Dice rolling interface styling
     - Game entry/landing page styling
     - Home page layout
     - Scene transition effects

The application appears to be a frontend for a game that includes dice rolling mechanics and scene-based progression, with user authentication enabled.
