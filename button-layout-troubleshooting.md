# Button Layout Issue Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Issue
The "Sign In" and "Watch" buttons are displaying vertically (one above the other) instead of horizontally side by side, despite various CSS attempts to force horizontal layout.

## Potential Causes

1. **Parent Container Constraints**
   - The parent container might have CSS properties that are forcing the buttons to wrap
   - There could be a max-width constraint somewhere in the parent hierarchy
   - Media queries might be affecting the layout at certain breakpoints

2. **HTML Structure**
   - There might be hidden HTML elements or whitespace affecting the layout
   - The button container's HTML structure might need verification
   - Line breaks or other elements between buttons could cause wrapping

3. **CSS Specificity Issues**
   - Other CSS rules might be overriding our layout attempts
   - Media queries or responsive design rules might be taking precedence
   - Third-party CSS could be interfering

## Next Steps for Investigation

1. **Inspect HTML Structure**
   - Verify the HTML structure of the buttons and their container
   - Ensure no unexpected elements exist between buttons
   - Check for proper closing tags and nesting

2. **Check Parent Elements**
   - Inspect all parent elements' CSS properties
   - Look for any width constraints or flex/grid properties
   - Verify there are no conflicting display properties

3. **Browser Dev Tools**
   - Use the browser's developer tools to inspect the computed styles
   - Check for any overridden CSS properties
   - Test disabling CSS properties to identify conflicts

4. **Test in Isolation**
   - Create a minimal test case with just the buttons
   - Remove all other CSS except for button layout
   - Gradually add back styles to identify the problem

5. **Cross-browser Testing**
   - Verify if the issue occurs in different browsers
   - Check if it's related to browser-specific CSS handling

## Alternative Solutions

1. Try using CSS Grid instead of Flexbox for the button container:
```css
.column .button-container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 160px);
    gap: 20px;
    justify-content: center;
}
```

2. Use absolute positioning for specific control:
```css
.column .button-container {
    position: relative;
    height: 50px;
}
.button-watch {
    position: absolute;
    left: 0;
}
.button-signin {
    position: absolute;
    right: 0;
}
```

3. Consider using CSS columns:
```css
.column .button-container {
    columns: 2;
    column-gap: 20px;
    width: 400px;
}
```

## Additional Considerations
- Check if any JavaScript is dynamically modifying the layout
- Verify if any CSS animations or transitions are affecting the layout
- Consider if responsive design breakpoints need adjustment
- Ensure all necessary vendor prefixes are included
